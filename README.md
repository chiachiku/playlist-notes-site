## Equipment Overview

### 1. Headphones / Earphones

| Model | Background | Sound Signature |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **STAX SR-L700 MK II** | Second-highest model in STAX's Lambda line. Replaceable 6N OFC + silver-plated flat cable. Technology derived from SR-009S. | Fast transients and silky treble. Neutral bass with clear layering. Pair with SRM-500T for warmth, ideal for indoor listening. |
| **Sennheiser HD 820** | German closed-back flagship with concave Gorilla Glass acoustic chambers to reduce standing waves. 300 Ω impedance. | Expansive soundstage for a closed design, extremely low distortion and precise imaging. Best when driven fully balanced from HDV 820. |
| **Meze 109 Pro** | Romanian handcrafted open-back dynamic. Wooden cups, 50 mm recessed diaphragm, 40 Ω impedance. | Full-bodied mids and lows, comfortable for long sessions. With the RU9 it gains thickness and a larger stage. |
| **Sennheiser IE 900** | Single 7 mm XWB dynamic IEM with aluminum CNC housing and triple-chamber damping. | Razor-like resolution and clean background. Excellent treble extension without harshness. Works well with RU9 in Modern Tube mode for smoother vocals. |
| **Sony IER-Z1R** | Triple dynamic hybrid flagship IEM (14 mm + 12 mm + 5 mm). Beryllium-coated bass, magnesium mid, acoustic tubes for "stage" presentation. | Strong bass presence and impact, transparent mids/highs with wide space. Pairs best with ZX707 for full Sony synergy. |

### 2. Amplifiers & Desktop DACs

| Model | Background | Highlights |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **STAX SRM-500T** | Hybrid FET + 6FQ7/6CG7 tube amplifier, 300 V RMS output. Bias 580 V DC. | Tube warmth softens typical electrostatic coldness. Compact stack for desks. |
| **Sennheiser HDV 820** | Dual AKM4490EQ DAC, supports PCM 32‑bit/384 kHz and DSD256. | Fully balanced amplification with 2 W @ 32 Ω. Matches HD 820's design. Can act as a preamp for powered speakers. |
| **iFi Zen DAC V3** | USB‑C powered, Burr‑Brown DAC, supports DSD256 and DXD 384 kHz. | X‑Bass and X‑Space toggles. PowerMatch gain for IEMs. Budget-friendly for office use. |

### 3. Portable Sources & DACs

| Model | Background | Highlights |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Sony NW-ZX707** | Android 12 Walkman with S‑Master HX digital amp. 64 GB storage + microSD. USB DAC up to 32‑bit/384 kHz, DSD 11.2 MHz. | DSEE Ultimate upscaling and Vinyl Processor. Smooth performance with QCS4290. Up to 25 hr battery for long trips. |
| **Cayin RU9** | Dual AK4493SEQ DAC + Nutube 6P1. Three tone modes (Classic Tube, Modern Tube, Solid State). 730 mW @ 32 Ω from 4.4 mm. USB‑C and Bluetooth 5.1. | With iPhone: 1) USB via Lightning camera adapter for up to 768 kHz/DSD512. 2) Bluetooth LDAC up to 96 kHz for convenience. Magnetic back plate sticks firmly to phone. Tube modes add harmonic richness, Solid State retains clarity. |

## Usage Tips

- **RU9 Switching**
  - Use Solid State mode for reference listening via USB, then try the tube modes for comparison.
  - Over Bluetooth choose LDAC 990 kbps. iPhone users need the *Cayin Audio* app for filter and tube mode options.
- **Cable Advice**
  - Use 4.4 mm balanced cables on 109 Pro, IE 900, and IER-Z1R so they work with the RU9, HDV 820, and ZX707.
  - STAX uses a dedicated 5‑pin cable; do not mix with dynamic headphone cables.
- **Quick Pairings**
  - Late night indoor → SR-L700 MK II with SRM-500T for ultra-low noise.
  - Office work → Meze 109 Pro with Zen DAC V3, enable X‑Space for a wider stage.
  - Commute → IE 900 with RU9 over Bluetooth.
  - Live rock → IER-Z1R with ZX707 on 4.4 mm.
